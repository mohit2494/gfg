'''
In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode
characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a
single character is simply a string with a length of 1. 

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

Strings in Python can be created using single quotes or double quotes
or even triple quotes.

String in single quotes cannot hold any other single quoted character
in it otherwise an error arises because the compiler wonâ€™t recognize
where to start and end the string. To overcome this error, use of
double quotes is preferred, because it helps in creation of Strings
with single quotes in them. For strings which contain Double quoted
words in them, use of triple quotes is suggested. Along with this,
triple quotes also allow the creation of multiline string

# accessing strings in python

'''
In Python, individual characters of a String can be accessed by using
the method of Indexing, to access a range of characters in the String,
method of slicing is used. Slicing in a String is done by using a
Slicing operator (colon). Indexing allows negative address references
to access characters from the back of the String, e.g. -1 refers to
the last character, -2 refers to the second last character and so on.
While accessing an index out of the range will cause an IndexError.
Only Integers are allowed to be passed as an index, float or other
types will cause a TypeError.
'''

# Python Program to Access 
# characters of String 
  
String1 = "GeeksForGeeks"
print("Initial String: ") 
print(String1) 
  
# Printing First character 
print("\nFirst character of String is: ") 
print(String1[0]) 
  
# Printing Last character 
print("\nLast character of String is: ") 
print(String1[-1]) 
  
# Printing 3rd to 12th character 
print("\nSlicing characters from 3-12: ") 
print(String1[3:12]) 
  
# Printing characters between  
# 3rd and 2nd last character 
print("\nSlicing characters between " +
    "3rd and 2nd last character: ") 
print(String1[3:-2])


# deleting or updating strings in python
'''
In Python, Updation or deletion of characters from a String is not
allowed. This will cause an error because item assignment or item
deletion from a String is not supported. Although deletion of entire
String is possible with the use of a built-in del keyword. This is
because Strings are immutable, hence elements of a String cannot be
changed once it has been assigned. Only new strings can be reassigned
to the same name.

String1 = "Hello, I'm a Geek"

#Deleting Entire String:
'''
Deletion of entire string is possible with the use of del keyword.
Further, if we try to print the string, this will produce an error
because String is deleted and is unavailable to be printed
'''
# Python Program to Delete 
# entire String 

String1 = "Hello, I'm a Geek"
print("Initial String: ")

del String1 
print("\nDeleting entire String: ") 
print(String1) 


# escape sequencing in python3
'''
While printing Strings with single and double quotes in it causes
SyntaxError because String already contains Single and Double Quotes
and hence cannot be printed with the use of either of these. Hence, to
print such a String either Triple Quotes are used or Escape sequences
are used to print such Strings. Escape sequences start with a
backslash and can be interpreted differently. If single quotes are
used to represent a string, then all the single quotes present in the
string must be escaped and same is done for Double Quotes. To ignore
the escape sequences in a String, r or R is used, this implies that
the string is a raw string and escape sequences inside it are to be
ignored.

# string formatting - not that useful for competitive programming
# but can be useful in general

'''
Strings in Python can be formatted with the use of format() method which is
very versatile and powerful tool for formatting of Strings. Format method in
String contains curly braces {} as placeholders which can hold arguments
according to position or keyword to specify the order. A string can be
left(<), right(>) or center(^) justified with the use of format specifiers,
separated by colon(:). Integers such as Binary, hexadecimal, etc. and floats
can be rounded or displayed in the exponent form with the use of format
specifiers.

# Python Program for 
# Formatting of Strings 

# Default order 
String1 = "{} {} {}".format('Geeks', 'For', 'Life') 
print("Print String in default order: ") 
print(String1) 

# Positional Formatting 
String1 = "{1} {0} {2}".format('Geeks', 'For', 'Life') 
print("\nPrint String in Positional order: ")

# Keyword Formatting

# Formatting of Integers
